## üîí Hidden Files from Public Repository

The following sensitive files have been removed from the public GitHub repository but are still available locally:

### Payment Gateway Files:
- `pgw.html` - Complete payment gateway with bKash integration
- `google-apps-script-payment-gateway.js` - Google Apps Script for payment processing
- `google-apps-script-payment-verification.js` - Payment verification script

### Documentation & Guides:
- `BKASH_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - bKash API integration guide
- `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_SETUP.md` - Payment gateway setup instructions
- `PRIVATE_REPO_SETUP.md` - Private repository setup guide
- `DASHBOARD_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Dashboard configuration guide

### Test Files:
- `test.html` - Testing page
- `test-apps-script.js` - Test script

## üìÇ Backup Recommendations:

1. **Create Private Repository:**
   ```bash
   git init aiba-marathon-private
   # Add all sensitive files to private repo
   ```

2. **Local Backup:**
   - Keep these files in a separate private folder
   - Regular backups to secure cloud storage

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - Use `.env` file for sensitive configuration
   - Never commit `.env` to any repository

## üåê Public Repository Contains:
- `index.html` - Main website
- `registration.html` - Registration page
- `team.html` - Team page
- `photos/` - Public images
- `styles.css` - Styling
- `script.js` - Public JavaScript
- Other public documentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notes:
- Payment gateway (`pgw.html`) is now hidden from public access
- bKash API credentials and configuration are protected
- Google Apps Script files with sensitive data are private
- All setup guides containing sensitive information are hidden

## üîß Development Workflow:
1. Work with sensitive files locally
2. Test payment gateway in local environment
3. Deploy to private hosting for production
4. Keep public repository clean and safe
